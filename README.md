# Phrases

Phrases looks for repeated phrases in a text document (or DOCX or ODT doc). You can set the
minimum and maximum number of words in the phrases it scans. It's meant for writers like me
who subconsciously "fall in love" with certain phrases in stories and novels (or any other
written material) and want to eliminate them.

For example, if you set it for a minimum of 2 and maximum of 4, and you have two sentences
like this:

He ran up the hill fast.
Later she ran up it slowly.

(Okay, lame example, but you'll see the point.) Phrases will catch the repetition.
